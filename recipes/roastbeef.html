    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3-4 pound beef roast (sirloin, rump, or top round)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary (crushed)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth or red wine (optional, for basting)</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <h3>
        <li>Prepare the Roast:</li>
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Remove the roast from the refrigerator and let it come to room temperature for about 30-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450°F (230°C).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <li>Season the Roast:</li>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pat the roast dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and rosemary.</li>
        <li>Rub the roast all over with olive oil, then coat it evenly with the seasoning mixture, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <li>Sear the Roast:</li>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat a large oven-safe skillet or roasting pan over medium-high heat. Sear the roast on all sides for 2-3 minutes per side until browned. This locks in the juices and adds a flavorful crust.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <li>Roast the Beef:</li>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Place the seared roast on a wire rack in a roasting pan (or directly in the pan if you don’t have a rack).</li>
        <li>Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the roast. Roast in the oven at 450°F for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F (160°C) and continue roasting until the internal temperature reaches:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rare: 125°F (52°C)</li>
            <li>Medium-rare: 135°F (57°C)</li>
            <li>Medium: 145°F (63°C)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>This typically takes 15-20 minutes per pound, but use the thermometer for accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <li>Rest the Roast:</li>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the roast from the oven and transfer it to a cutting board. Tent it loosely with aluminum foil and let it rest for 15-20 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the meat tender and moist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <li>Make a Simple Gravy (Optional):</li> 
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>While the roast rests, place the roasting pan with drippings on the stovetop over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Deglaze the pan with beef broth or red wine, scraping up any browned bits.</li>
        <li>Simmer and reduce slightly, then season to taste. Strain if desired.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        <li>Slice and Serve:</li>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Slice the roast against the grain into thin slices. Serve with your favorite sides, like roasted vegetables, mashed potatoes, or Yorkshire puddings, and drizzle with gravy for extra flavor.</li>
    </ul>

</ol>

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
<p>This roast beef is perfect for any occasion and makes fantastic leftovers for sandwiches or salads!</p><br>
