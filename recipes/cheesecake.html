    </ul>

        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional, for stability)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Optional Toppings:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh fruit (berries, sliced kiwi, or mango)</li>
        <li>Chocolate or caramel drizzle</li>
        <li>Whipped cream</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <h3>
        <li>Prepare the Crust:</li>
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan or line the bottom with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Mix until the texture resembles wet sand.</li>
        <li>Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the prepared pan. Use the bottom of a flat glass or measuring cup to pack it down firmly. Bake for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        <li>Make the Filling:</li>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition until just combined. Avoid overmixing to prevent cracks.</li>
        <li>Mix in the vanilla extract, sour cream, and flour (if using), ensuring a smooth and lump-free batter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        <li>Assemble the Cheesecake:</li>
    </h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Pour the filling over the cooled crust, spreading it evenly. Tap the pan gently on the counter to release any air bubbles.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        <li>Bake the Cheesecake:</li>
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Place the springform pan in a larger roasting pan and fill the roasting pan with hot water until it reaches halfway up the sides of the cheesecake pan (water bath method to prevent cracks).</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 60-70 minutes, or until the edges are set and the center jiggles slightly when shaken.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        <li>Cool the Cheesecake:</li>
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Turn off the oven and crack the door open slightly. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, then run a knife around the edges to loosen the cheesecake. Let it cool completely at room temperature before refrigerating for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        <li>Serve:</li>
    </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Carefully remove the cheesecake from the springform pan. Slice and serve as is, or add your favorite toppings like fruit, chocolate drizzle, or whipped cream</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
<p>This classic cheesecake is creamy, smooth, and absolutely divine. Perfect for any celebration or just to treat yourself!</p>
