        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Cheese Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (or 2 teaspoons dried)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Layers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles (cooked according to package instructions or use no-boil noodles)</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <h3><li>Make the Meat Sauce:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and sausage to the skillet, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon. Cook until browned and no longer pink. Drain any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, sugar, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><li>Prepare the Cheese Filling:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix until smooth and set aside.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><li>Preheat the Oven:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Layer 3-4 lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, and sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat these layers two more times, finishing with a generous layer of mozzarella and Parmesan on top.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3><li>Bake the Lasagna:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil (spray the underside with cooking spray to prevent sticking) and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><li>Let It Rest:</li></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes serving easier.</li>
        </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Serve and Enjoy!</h3>
<p>Pair with a side of garlic bread and a fresh green salad for a complete meal. Leftovers store beautifully in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or can be frozen for later!</p>
